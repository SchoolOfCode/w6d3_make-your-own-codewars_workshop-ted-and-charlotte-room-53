/* 
ðŸ‘‰ Write your kata here!

Take an array of numbers and translate each into its corresponding letter to form a word. 
If a number in the array is below 1 or the array is empty it should throw an error that says, "This array is not valid.".
If a number is above 26 it should start from A again and loop around. 

For example: 
[6, 15, 15, 4] should return food.
[-2, 4, 20] should return an error.
[32, 15, 15, 30] should return food.

//ðŸ‘‰ Write the function your CodeWarriors will start with below here:
export function getWordFromNumbers(arr){
    
    return word
}
